# Elder Wand Tennis
The Elder Wand Tennis project is a Python application that analyzes historical tennis data to track the "transfer" of the "Elder Wand" among players. The concept of the "Elder Wand" is a metaphor from the Harry Potter series where a magical item changes its allegiance to a person who defeats its current owner. Similarly, the "Elder Wand" in this context is a metaphor for the top tennis player spot. The player who beats the current holder becomes the new holder of the "Elder Wand".

The code fetches tennis match data from ATP and WTA tours from the year 1968 onwards. It provides functionalities to analyze the data to track the transfer of the "Elder Wand" among tennis players.
